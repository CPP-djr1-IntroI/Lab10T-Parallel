## Intro to C++ I Lab 10

Functions, Arrays, Parallel Arrays

**Goals:**

1.  Use functions in conjunction with arrays

2.  Understand what a parallel array is

3.  Use the debugger effectively especially when arrays go out of bounds


**Lab 10**

Clone the code for Lab10. The driver, main.cpp, is mostly commented out.
You are to implement one function at a time starting with the first function
prototype and then uncomment the code in main that uses said function and
test. After each completed function, you should push to GitHub with an
appropriate message.

A correct final run result will look like the following:

<pre>
** Printing Array A:   1  2  3  4  5

** Printing Array B:  10  9  8  7  6

** Sum Of Array A: 15

** Sum Of Array B: 40

** Print arrayA after adding 6 at the end:   1  2  3  4  5  6

** Print arrayA after adding 6 at the beginning:   6  1  2  3  4  5  6

** Print arrayC after copying arrayA to arrayC:   6  1  2  3  4  5  6

** Is arrayC equal to arrayA: Arrays are equal

** Printing Array A Reversed:   6  5  4  3  2  1  6

** Reverse Array B and check isSorted: Array B is sorted

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab10 Link on The C++ Tutorials in the section Data Input to accept this
        assignment as we've done before. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to each project specified above. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab10ParallelArrays.pdf) 
of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
